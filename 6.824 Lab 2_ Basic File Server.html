<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this lab, you will start your file system implementation by
getting the following FUSE operations to work:
<ul>
<li> CREATE/MKNOD, LOOKUP, and READDIR 
</li><li> SETATTR, WRITE and READ
</li></ul>


Recall that YFS has the following architecture.
<p>
</p><center><img src="./6.824 Lab 2_ Basic File Server_files/yfs.jpg"></center>
<p>
</p><p>
We provide you with skeleton code for both the YFS and extent server modules above.  

</p><p>
The YFS module implements the core file system logic.
This module runs as a single process called <tt>yfs_client</tt> that supports 
a mountpoint on the local host.  The code skeleton for this module consists of two pieces:

</p><ul>

<li><b>The FUSE interface,</b> in
<tt>fuse.cc</tt>. It translates FUSE operations from
the FUSE kernel modules into YFS client calls.  We
provide you with much of the code needed to register with FUSE and receive
FUSE operations; you will be mostly responsible for 
modifying <tt>fuse.cc</tt> to call the appropriate
methods on the <tt>yfs_client</tt> class and reply
back over the FUSE interface.

</li><li><b>The YFS client,</b> in <tt>yfs_client.{cc,h}</tt>. 
The YFS client implements the file system logic,
using the lock and extent servers to help it.
For example, when creating a new file, your yfs_client will add directory entries to 
a directory block in the extent server.
It is called a client, rather than a file server, because of its
relationship to the lock and extent servers.

</li></ul>

<p>
The extent server stores
all the data representing your 
filesystem, much like a hard disk in an ordinary file system.
In later labs, you will run YFS clients on multiple hosts,
all of them talking to the same extent server;
the desired effect is that all the hosts see and share the same file system.
The only way the multiple YFS clients can share data is through
the extent server. The extent server code skeleton consists of 
two pieces:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Extent client,</b> in <tt>extent_client.{cc,h}</tt>.
This is a wrapper class for communicationg with extent server using RPCs.
</li><li><b>Extent server,</b> in <tt>extent_server.{cc,h}</tt> and 
<tt>extent_smain.cc</tt>.  The extent server manages a simple key-value store.
It requires integers of type
<tt>extent_protocol::extentid_t</tt>
for keys, and stores string values
(<tt>std::string</tt>), without interpreting the contents of those
strings.  It also stores an "attribute" for key/value pair.
Your extent server should support put(key,value), get(key),
getattr(key), and remove(key) RPCs.
</li></ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>


First, use a computer with FUSE and the FUSE libraries installed (see
the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/labs/index.html#fuse">Lab Overview</a> for details).

<p>
Merge your solution to Lab 1 with the new code we
supply for Lab 2. To do this, first commit your solution to Lab 1:

</p><pre>% <b>cd lab</b>
% <b>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</b>
Created commit 254dac5: my solution to lab1
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
</pre>

Before you commit, you will need to explicitly
<tt><nobr>git add</nobr></tt> any new files you
added. Run <tt><nobr>git status</nobr></tt> to show all the files that
were added or changed.

<p>
Next, fetch the latest version of the course repository, then create a
local branch called <tt>lab2</tt> based on our lab2 branch,
<tt>origin/lab2</tt>:

</p><pre>% <b>git pull</b>
remote: Generating pack...
[...]
% <b>git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2</b>
Branch lab2 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab2.
Switched to a new branch "lab2"
%
</pre>

<p>
The <tt><nobr>git checkout -b</nobr></tt> command shown above actually
does two things: it first creates a local branch <tt>lab2</tt> that is
based on the <tt>origin/lab2</tt> branch provided by the course staff,
and second, it changes the contents of your <tt>lab</tt> directory to
reflect the files stored on the <tt>lab2</tt> branch.  Git allows
switching between existing branches using <tt><nobr>git
checkout <i>branch-name</i></nobr></tt>, though you should commit any
outstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different one.

</p><p>
You will now need to merge the changes you made in your <tt>lab1</tt>
branch into the <tt>lab2</tt> branch, as follows:

</p><pre>% <b>git merge lab1</b>
</pre>

Git may not be able to figure out how to merge your
changes with the new lab assignment (e.g., if you modified some of the
code that the second lab assignment changes).  In that case,
<tt><nobr>git merge</nobr></tt> will tell you which files
have <emph>conflicts</emph>, and you should first resolve the conflicts
(by editing the relevant files) and then run
<tt><nobr>git commit -a</nobr></tt>.

<p>
Here's how to run the extent server and 
<tt>yfs_client</tt>(s).  If you are using the class machines, choose a port number that
other students aren't using. For example, to run the extent server on port
3772, type this:
</p><pre>% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>make</b>
% <b>./extent_server 3772 &amp;</b>
</pre>

<p>
Next, start the 
<tt>yfs_client</tt> process using three parameters: a unique mountpoint (that other students aren't using), 
the extent server's port number, and
the lock server's port number (not used in this lab).  
The mountpoint must be an empty directory that already exists. 
To start the <tt>yfs_client</tt> using mountpoint <tt>./myfs</tt> and <tt>extent_server</tt> that listens on port 3772, type this:
</p><pre>% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>mkdir myfs</b>
% <b>./yfs_client ./myfs 3772 3762 &amp;</b>
</pre>

<p>We provide you with the script <tt>start.sh</tt> to automatically start <tt>extent_server</tt> and <tt>yfs_client</tt>,
and <tt>stop.sh</tt> to kill previously started processes.  Actually, <tt>start.sh</tt> starts two <tt>yfs_client</tt>s with 
<tt>./yfs1</tt> and <tt>./yfs2</tt> mountpoints respectively. Thus you can type:
</p><pre>% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>./start.sh</b>
% <b>./test-lab-2-a.pl ./yfs1</b>
% <b>./test-lab-2-b.pl ./yfs1 ./yfs2</b>
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<font color="red">
If <tt>stop.sh</tt> reports "Device or resource busy", please keep executing
<tt>stop.sh</tt> until it says "not found in /etc/mtab", such as</font>:

</p><pre>fusermount: entry for /home/your_name/yfs-class/yfs1 not found in /etc/mtab
fusermount: entry for /home/your_name/yfs-class/yfs2 not found in /etc/mtab
...
</pre>

<p>
The skeleton code implements only GETATTR and STATFS,
so the file system you just mounted will not be very useful.
You will implement more FUSE operations in this lab to 
make your file system more functional.
</p><ul>

<li>In Part 1, you should implement CREATE/MKNOD, LOOKUP and READDIR.
Your code should pass the 
<tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt> script, which tests creating empty files, 
looking up names in a directory, and listing directory contents.

</li><li>In Part 2, you should implement SETATTR, READ, and WRITE.
Your code should pass the <tt>test-lab-2-b.pl</tt> 
script, which tests reading, writing, and appending to files, as well as testing 
whether files written on one yfs_client instance can be read through a second one.
</li></ul>


<p>
If you are using your own Linux machine, make sure your user ID is in the <tt>fuse</tt> group so that
you can mount without being root. See <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/labs/index.html">Lab Overview</a>
about how to add a user to the <tt>fuse</tt> group. On FreeBSD, you can run <tt>sysctl 
vfs.usermount=1</tt> as root, and then you should be able to run <tt>yfs_client</tt> 
as a normal user. Most Linux machines at MIT are already configured to allow mount 
without being root, for example:
</p><ul>
<li>linerva.mit.edu
</li><li>linux.mit.edu
</li><li>athena.dialup.mit.edu
</li><li>athena.lcs.mit.edu
</li></ul>
<p>
Lab 2 is known to work on Leopard, Tiger, and Snow Leopard.

</p><h2>Part 1: CREATE/MKNOD, LOOKUP, and READDIR</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Your Job</h3>

 <p>Your job in Part 1 is to implement the extent server, then implement the
CREATE/MKNOD, LOOKUP and READDIR
FUSE operations in YFS. You must store the file system's contents in
the extent server, so that in Part 2 and future labs you can share one file
system among <tt>yfs_client</tt>s.  It is OK for your
extent server to store data only in memory; this means that
if you restart it, all the data previously stored will be lost.

</p><p>
On some systems, FUSE uses the MKNOD operation to create files, and on
others, it uses CREATE. The two interfaces have slight differences,
but in order to spare you the details, we have given you wrappers for
both that call the common routine
<tt>createhelper()</tt>. You should implement <tt>createhelper()</tt>.

</p><p>
As before, if your server passes our tester on the  official class
programming environment, you are done. If you have questions about whether you
have to implement specific pieces of file system functionality, then you should
be guided by the tester: if you can pass the tests without implementing
something, then you do not have to implement it.  For example, you don't need
to implement the exclusive create semantics of the CREATE/MKNOD operation.  You
may modify or add any files you like, except that you should not modify the
the tester script or the RPC library.

</p><p>
The Lab 2 tester for Part 1 is <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt>. Run it 
with your YFS mountpoint as the argument. Here's what a
successful run of <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt> looks like:
</p><pre>% <b>./test-lab-2-a.pl ./yfs1</b>
create file-yyuvjztagkprvmxjnzrbczmvmfhtyxhwloulhggy-18674-0
create file-hcmaxnljdgbpirprwtuxobeforippbndpjtcxywf-18674-1
...
Passed all tests!
</pre>

The tester creates lots of files with names like <tt>file-XXX-YYY-Z</tt> and
checks that they appear in directory listings.

<p>
If you implemented at-most-once RPC correctly, the tests
should pass with <tt>RPC_LOSSY</tt> set to 5 as well.

</p><p>
If <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt> exits without printing "Passed all tests!", then it
thinks something is wrong with your file server. For example, if you
run <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt> on the skeleton code we give you, you'll probably
see an error message like this:
</p><pre>test-lab-2-a: cannot create /tmp/b/file-ddscdywqxzozdoabhztxexkvpaazvtmrmmvcoayp-21501-0 : No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>
This error message appears because you have not yet provided code
to handle the CREATE/MKNOD operation with FUSE.
That code belongs in <tt>fuseserver_createhelper</tt> in
<tt>fuse.cc</tt>.

</p><p>
 <b>Note:</b>
testing Part 1 on the command line using commands like
<tt>touch</tt> will not work until you implement the SETATTR
operation in Part 2.  For now, you
should do your testing via the <tt>creat/open</tt>, <tt>lookup</tt>,
and <tt>readdir</tt> system calls in a language like Perl, or simply
use the provided test script.


</p><h3>Part 1: Detailed Guidance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the extent server:

You will need to implement the extent server
  in <tt>extent_server.cc</tt>. There are four operations:
<tt>put(key,value)</tt>, <tt>get(key)</tt>, <tt>getattr(key)</tt>,
and <tt>remove(key)</tt>. The <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> RPCs are
used to update and retrieve an extent's contents. The <tt>getattr</tt>
RPC retrieves an extent's "attributes". The attributes consist of the
size of the extent, the last content modification time (<tt>mtime</tt>), the
last attribute change time
(<tt>ctime</tt>), and last content access time (<tt>atime</tt>).
The times are seconds since 1970, such as returned by the <tt>time()</tt> 
call.
These are really here to help you mimic the behavior of
UNIX i-nodes; you will be able to use the attributes stored
in the extent server rather than having to explicitly store
i-nodes separately from file data.
Your extent server should
set the <tt>ctime</tt> and <tt>mtime</tt> to the current time
in <tt>put()</tt>, and set the <tt>atime</tt> to the current
time in <tt>get()</tt>.
<p>

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b>
<font color="red">Although the test scripts of Lab 2 access
<tt>extent_server</tt> sequentially, we recommend you use a
mutex in <tt>extent_server</tt> to avoid future races.
</font>

</p></li><li>File/directory IDs:

<p>Both YFS and FUSE need to be able to identify each file and
directory with a unique identifier, analogous to the i-node number of
an on-disk UNIX file system. FUSE uses 32-bit numbers as identifiers.
Your YFS code should use 64-bit numbers whose high 32 bits are zero and
whose low 32 bits are the same as the file/directory's FUSE identifier.
We have defined such an 64-bit identifier (called <i>inum</i>) in
<tt>yfs_client.h</tt>.

</p><p>
When creating a new file (<tt>fuseserver_createhelper</tt>) or directory 
(<tt>fuseserver_mkdir</tt>), you must assign a unique <tt>inum</tt>.
The easiest thing to do is to pick a number at random, hoping that it will
indeed be unique. (What's the collision probability as the number of 
files and directories grows?)

</p><p>
YFS needs to be able to tell whether a particular <tt>inum</tt> refers to 
a file or a directory. Do this by allocating IDs with the 31st bit of one
for new files, and IDs with the 31st bit of zero for new directories.
The method <tt>yfs_client::isfile</tt> assumes this property holds for
<tt>inum</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> <font color="red">You are asked to implement
<tt>fuseserver_mkdir</tt> in Lab 3. But do follow this <tt>inum</tt> naming
rule in <tt>fuseserver_createhelper</tt> to make your Lab 3 easier.</font>
</p><p>

</p></li><li>Directory format:
<p>
Next, you must choose the format for directories. A directory's
content contains a set of name to <tt>inum</tt> mappings. You should
store a directory's entire content in a single entry in the extent
server, with the directory's <tt>inum</tt> as the key.
LOOKUP and READDIR read directory contents,
and CREATE/MKNOD modify directory contents.

</p><p>
You do not have to implement file modes, permissions, or owners.

</p></li>

<li>FUSE:

<p>
When a program (such as <tt>ls</tt> or a test script) manipulates a file or
directory (such as <tt>yfs1</tt>) served by your <tt>yfs_client</tt>,
the FUSE code in the kernel sends corresponding operations to <tt>yfs_client</tt>
via FUSE.
The code we provide you in <tt>fuse.cc</tt> responds to each
such operation by calling one of a number of procedures,
for create, read, write, etc. operations.
You should modify the relevant routines in <tt>fuse.cc</tt> to
call methods in <tt>yfs_client.cc</tt>. <tt>fuse.cc</tt>
should just contain glue code, and the core of your file system
logic should be in <tt>yfs_client.cc</tt>.
For example, to handle file creation, you should modify
<tt>fuseserver_createhelper</tt> to call <tt>yfs-&gt;create(...)</tt>,
and you should add a new <tt>create(...)</tt> method to
<tt>yfs_client.cc</tt>. Look at <tt>getattr()</tt> in <tt>fuse.cc</tt>
for an example of how a fuse operation handler works, how it calls
methods in <tt>yfs_client</tt>, and how it sends results
and errors back to the kernel.
YFS uses FUSE's "lowlevel" API. 

</p><p>
You can find details on what the methods you implement need to do at <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/doxygen/fuse__lowlevel_8h.html">fuse_lowlevel.h</a>.
Every FUSE handler should either return a successful result to the kernel
using one of the <tt>fuse_reply_...</tt> routines, or else
call <tt>fuse_reply_err</tt> to report an error.

</p><p>
Sending back directory information for READDIR is a bit
tricky, so we've provided you with much of the necessary code in the
<tt>dirbuf_add</tt>, <tt>reply_buf_limited</tt>, and
<tt>fuseserver_readdir</tt> methods.  All that's left for you to do
for READDIR in <tt>fuse.cc</tt> is to get the directory listing from
your <tt>yfs_client</tt>, and add it to the <tt>b</tt> data structure
using <tt>dirbuf_add</tt>.

</p><p>
<font color="red">
Though you are free to choose any <tt>inum</tt> identifier you like for
newly created files, FUSE assumes that the <tt>inum</tt> for the root
directory is <tt>0x00000001</tt>.  Thus, you'll need to ensure that
when <tt>yfs_client</tt> starts, it is ready to export an empty directory stored under
that <tt>inum</tt></font>.
</p></li>

<li>YFS code:

<p>The bulk of your file system logic should be in <tt>yfs_client</tt>,
for the most part in routines that correspond to fuse operations
(create, read, write, mkdir, &amp;c). Your <tt>fuse.cc</tt> code should
pass <tt>inum</tt>s, file names, &amp;c to your <tt>yfs_client</tt> methods.
Your <tt>yfs_client</tt> code should retrieve file and directory
contents from the extent server with <tt>get()</tt>, using the
<tt>inum</tt> as the extent ID. In the case of directories, your
<tt>yfs_client</tt> code should parse the directory content
into a sequence of name/<tt>inum</tt> pairs (i.e. <tt>yfs_client::dirent</tt>s), for lookups, and be able 
to add new name/<tt>inum</tt> pairs. You should not modify the
extent server for this part of the lab.

</p></li>

<li>Tips:

<p>
A reasonable way to get going on <tt>fuse.cc</tt>
is to run <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt>, find the
function in <tt>fuse.cc</tt> whose missing implementation is
causing the tester to fail, and start fixing that function.
Look at the end of <tt>yfs_client1.log</tt> and/or add your own
print statements to <tt>fuse.cc</tt>.

</p><p>
If a file already exists, the CREATE operator (<tt>fuseserver_create</tt> and
<tt>fuseserver_mknod</tt>) should return EEXIST to FUSE. This is hard to test
at this point, but may arise in Lab 3 with concurrent creation of
the same file from different clients.

</p><p>

<tt>start.sh</tt> redirects the STDOUT and STDERR of the
servers to files in the current 
directory.  For example, any output you make from fuse.cc will be
written to <tt>yfs_client1.log</tt>.  Thus, you should look at these
files for any debug information you print out in your code.

<!--
<p>
You can get FUSE to print out the requests and results of
operations it passes to your file system.  To turn this on, add the
following line of code to the <tt>main()</tt> function of
<tt>fuse.cc</tt>, just before the assignment of <tt>mountpoint</tt>
into <tt>fuse_argv</tt>:

<pre>
fuse_argv[fuse_argc++] = "-d";
</pre>
-->

</p><p>
See the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/labs/index.html#tips">lab overview</a> 
for general hacking and debugging tips.

</p><p>
If you wish to test your code with only some of the FUSE hooks implemented,
be advised that FUSE may implicitly try to call other hooks. For example, FUSE
calls LOOKUP when mounting the file system, so you may want to implement that
first. FUSE prints out to the <tt>yfs_client1.log</tt> file the requests and
results of operations it passes to your file system. You can study this file to
see exactly what hooks are called at every step. 

</p></li></ul>

<h2>Part 2: SETATTR, READ, WRITE</h2>
<h3>Part 2: Your Job</h3>

Your job in Part 2 is to implement SETATTR, WRITE, and READ FUSE operations in
<tt>fuse.cc</tt>.
Once your server passes <tt>test-lab-2-b.pl</tt>, you are done.
If you have questions about whether you have to
implement specific pieces of FUSE functionality, then you should be
guided by the tester: if you can pass the tests without implementing something,
then don't bother implementing it.  Please don't modify the test program
or the RPC library. We will use our own versions of
these files during grading.

<p>
<tt>test-lab-2-b.pl</tt> 
tests reading, writing, and appending to files, as well as
testing whether files written on one <tt>yfs_client</tt> instance
can be read through a
second one.
To run the tester, first start two <tt>yfs_client</tt>s using
the <tt>start.sh</tt> script.  It runs two
<tt>yfs_client</tt> processes each mounting the <b>same</b> file system under a different name
(<tt>yfs1</tt> or <tt>yfs2</tt>). 

</p><pre>% <b>./start.sh</b>
</pre>

<p> 
Now run <tt>test-lab-2-b.pl</tt> by passing the <tt>yfs1</tt>
and <tt>yfs2</tt> mountpoints. 
Since the script tests the <tt>yfs_client</tt>s sequentially,
<font color="red">
you do not need to worry about locking for this lab</font>.

</p><pre>% <b>./test-lab-2-b.pl ./yfs1 ./yfs2</b>
Write and read one file: OK
Write and read a second file: OK
Overwrite an existing file: OK
Append to an existing file: OK
Write into the middle of an existing file: OK
Check that one cannot open non-existant file: OK
Check directory listing: OK
Read files via second server: OK
Check directory listing on second server: OK
Passed all tests
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
</pre>

<p>
If <tt>test-lab-2-b.pl</tt> exits without printing "Passed all tests!" or hangs
indefinitely, then something is wrong with your file server.
After you are done with Part 2, you should go back
and test with <tt>test-lab-2-a.pl</tt> again to
make sure you did not break anything.

</p><h3>Part 2: Detailed Guidance</h3>
<ul>

<li>Implementing SETATTR
<p>
The operating system can tell your file system to set one or more
attributes via the FUSE SETATTR operation.  See <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/doxygen/fuse__lowlevel_8h.html">fuse_lowlevel.h</a>
for the relevant definitions.  The <tt>to_set</tt> argument
to your SETATTR handler is a mask that indicates which
attributes should be set.  There is really only one attribute (the file size attribute) you
need to pay attention to (but feel free to implement the others if you like), 
indicated by bit <tt>FUSE_SET_ATTR_SIZE</tt>.  Just AND (i.e., <tt>&amp;</tt>) the
<tt>to_set</tt> mask value with an attribute's bitmask to see if the attribute
is to be set.  The new value for the attribute to be set is in the
<tt>attr</tt> parameter passed to your SETATTR handler.

</p><p>
The operating system may implement overwriting an existing file
with a call to SETATTR (to truncate the file) rather than CREATE.

</p><p>
Setting the size attribute of a file can correspond to
truncating it completely to zero bytes, truncating it to a subset of
its current length, or even padding bytes on to the file to make it
bigger.  Your system should handle all these cases correctly.
</p></li>

<li>Implementing READ/WRITE:

<p>
A read (<tt>fuseserver_read</tt>) wants up to <tt>size</tt> bytes from a file,
starting from a certain offset. When less than <tt>size</tt> bytes are
available, you should return to fuse only the available number of bytes. See
the manpage for <tt>read(2)</tt> for details.
</p>

<p>
For writes (<tt>fuseserver_write</tt>), a non-obvious situation may
arise if the client tries to write at a file offset that's past the
current end of the file.  Linux expects the file system to return
'\0's for any reads of unwritten bytes in these "holes" (see the
manpage for <tt>lseek(2)</tt> for details). Your write should handle
this case correctly.

</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Handin procedure</h3>

E-mail your code as a gzipped tar file to <a href="mailto:6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu">6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu</a>
by the deadline at the
top of the page.  To do this, execute these commands:

<pre>% <b>cd ~/lab</b>
% <b>./stop.sh</b>
% <b>make clean</b>
% <b>rm core*</b>
% <b>rm *log</b>
% <b>cd ..</b>
% <b>tar czvf `whoami`-lab2.tgz lab</b>
</pre>

or

<pre>% <b>cd ~/6.824/lab</b>
% <b>make handin</b>
</pre>

That should produce a file called <tt>[your_user_name]-lab2.tgz</tt> in your
home directory.  Attach that file to an email and send it to
<a href="mailto:6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu">6.824-submit@pdos.csail.mit.edu</a>.
